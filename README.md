challenges:
1. figuring out how to use google places api
2. dk how to feature encode (cuisine type)
   - idk how to assign numeric value to chinese food and differentiate that w french food
   - idk what to do if api doesnt provide sufficient data to assign cuisine to a resturant
4. lack of data causing ambiguity (restaurants dont have specific cuisine data so it becomes unkonwn which cuisine something is)
